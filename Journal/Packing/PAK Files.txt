PAK files are just file streams layered on top of each other.


Also, PAK files are embedded into Flash file automatically.
	- I've set embed="false" to see if this is still the case.

HTML5 requires libraries to be registered, prefixes to be used.

Not sure about flash?
	- 

<assets unless="flash" path="assets/cloudInfoRoom" embed="false" library="cloudInfoRoom" />
<assets if="flash" path="assets/cloudInfoRoom" embed="true" library="cloudInfoRoom" preload="true" />
<library name="cloudInfoRoom" type="pak" />

roomName + ":assets/" + roomName + "/images/" + roomName + ".png"

That works
